## 2. Getting Started

**Q: How do I add a bookmark or video?**  
A: Paste a URL directly into NestMind or use the iOS Share Sheet from Safari or YouTube.

**Q: What are “Threads”?**  
A: Threads let you group todos, bookmarks, and videos into a single context — your own learning or project “journeys.”

## 3. Sync (iCloud / CloudKit)

**Q: What happens if I enable CloudKit after I already have local data?**  
A: Existing local items are uploaded to your private iCloud container.  
The first sync may take a few minutes — keep the app open until it completes.

**Q: I enabled sync but don’t see my data on another device.**  
A: Make sure:
- You’re signed in to the same Apple ID  
- iCloud Drive is enabled  
- NestMind has iCloud permission  
Then open NestMind on both devices to trigger sync.

## 4. Assistant

**Q: Does the Assistant send my data to servers?**  
A: No. NestMind’s Assistant runs entirely on your device.  
If any future feature requires network access (for example, link previews), you’ll be asked before anything leaves your device.

## 5. Data & Privacy

**Q: How can I export or delete my data?**  
A: Go to **Settings → Data Management** inside the app.  
You can export or delete your local data at any time.  
To delete synced data from iCloud, disable sync and follow Apple’s iCloud deletion instructions.

---

## 6. Known Issues

- Initial CloudKit sync can take longer for large libraries — keep the app in the foreground until complete.  
- If you reinstall the app, re-enable sync to restore your data from iCloud.
